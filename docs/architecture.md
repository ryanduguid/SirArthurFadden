## Why the code is shaped the way it is

[BUILD.md](../BUILD.md) lists every trap the code exists to avoid. Each one cost a
real defect. The short version:

- **Unordered `$skip`/`$top` paging silently drops rows.** No `$orderby` meant
  142 of 813 titles vanished, including the Tax Agent Services Act 2009.
- **`curl` does not truncate `-o` on transport failure**, so a shared temp file
  re-read the previous response and handed one Act another Act's compilation.
  The JSON stages read the response off the socket now, so they carry no temp
  file to inherit; `download.py` still uses `curl`, to a per-title path.
- **The download endpoint answers in two shapes**, raw EPUB bytes or a JSON
  envelope with the file base64 inside. Sniff the first byte.
- **HTTP errors and non-EPUB responses stop the download stage.** They are not
  evidence that a document is absent and must not be counted as `no_epub`.
  Only a validated staged download is moved to an `.epub` path.
- **The current version can have no document.** The Register records that an
  amendment commenced before publishing the compilation, so the URL 404s. That
  is not a broken download. Only an explicit null `registerId` on the current
  version is recorded as `no_epub`; the count changes as compilations are
  published.
- **Acts use two Word templates; instruments use dozens.** Deciding the template
  from the markup fails, because cosmetic classes look structural. Run the
  structural pass, and only when it finds nothing at all re-run with the
  bare-paragraph fallback, verified not to change a single Act row.
- **Never filter images by byte size.** Doing so deleted a GST decision
  flowchart and a maintenance-income formula.
